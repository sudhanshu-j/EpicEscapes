## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run **EpicEscapes** locally on your machine, you’ll need:

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

- (Optional) A local development server for testing

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/epicescapes.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd epicescapes
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file**: You can view the project in action by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. You can do this directly by double-clicking the file, or using a text editor's preview feature.

4. **(Optional) Use a Local Server**: If you want to simulate a real server environment (and handle advanced features like dynamic URLs or routing), you can run a local server using one of the following methods:

   - **VS Code Live Server Extension**: Install the extension and launch the server directly from the editor. This allows for hot-reloading and a more accurate representation of how the website will function in a production environment.

   - **http-server (Node.js)**: Install using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     ```
     Then, navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     http-server
     ```

     This will start a local server, and you can access the website at `http://localhost:8080` (or another specified port).

## Usage

### Key Interactions on the Website:

- **Hamburger Menu**: On mobile screens, the navigation menu appears as a hamburger icon. When clicked, it toggles a side menu that shows the navigation options. On larger screens, the menu is displayed in the top navigation bar.

- **Scroll Effects**:

  - **Blurred Header**: As users scroll down, the header background becomes blurred, providing a sleek effect as the user navigates.

  - **Scroll-Up Button**: When users scroll down 350px or more, a button appears allowing them to quickly scroll back to the top of the page.

  - **Active Navigation Links**: As the user scrolls through the page, the navigation menu dynamically highlights the corresponding section’s link based on the user’s current scroll position.

  - **Animations**: The ScrollReveal.js library creates smooth animations for elements as they come into the viewport. You’ll notice cards, text, and images appear with engaging animations when scrolling.

- **Explore & Travel Packages**: The homepage and other sections feature interactive cards that introduce the most popular destinations. These cards display beautiful images with descriptions of travel destinations, and clicking on them leads to more information.

- **Join Us**: This section encourages users to join EpicEscapes, whether by subscribing to newsletters, contacting for bookings, or learning more about the agency’s services.
